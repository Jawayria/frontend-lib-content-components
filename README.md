# How to develop this package

There are to distinct way to observe your changes. One can either either require your MFE to pull in its javascript from a local version of this package, or simply run the gallery view.

# Using your prexisting MFE and moduleconfig.js

# Using the gallery view.
The gallery view runs the editor components with mocked out block data, and sometimes does not replicate all desired behaviors, but can be used for faster iteration on UI related changes. To run the gallery view, from the root directory, run

$ cd www
$ npm start

and now the gallery will be live at http://localhost:8080/index.html. use the toggle at the top to switch between availible editors.

# Add A New Xblock Editor
